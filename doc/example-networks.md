# Example networks

## Synfire chain
![](figures/example-networks/synfirechain.png)
The name synfire chain is an abbreviation for synchronous firing chain and describes a circular feed-forward chain, in which activity travels from layer to layer.
When suitably configured, a spike in one of our neurons will elicit a consecutive spike in the next neuron in the chain.

This can also be put in a circular shape where the activity travels indefinitely.
